<h1>Front-End Assessment</h1>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Create a responsive page displaying two sets of cards of data, with different
layouts.
Make the page responsive, including mobile and tablet classes for buttons
Have a working hamburger menu</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I chose to use eleventy w/ nunjucks to tackle the problem, in order to become
more familiar with them. This allowed me to create macros for the cards as well
as the tooltip ( I called it popover), eliminating redundant coding where possible</p>
<p>The responsive design was handled using flexbox for the page layout and css grid
for the cards.</p>
<p>A few simple JS functions called on page load handle the button class assignment,
hamburger open/close, as well as the tooltip mouseover.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The rendered eleventy page works well, with CSS and JS embedded directly in the html.
Only the tooltip SVG is loaded separately, since it appears in multiple locations.</p>
<p>Given more time, I would probably fix the hardcoded tooltips that appear in the
pricing.js data. Also, link/ button hover states and hamburger and tooltip
appearance can be refined given brand guidelines.</p>

# New Relic Front End Assessment

## Instructions

1. For the assessment we’ll be building out a responsive static html page that matches the designs here: https://www.figma.com/file/1wkJ7ybcJYaBkIXfdV1X2a/FE-Coding-Assessment%2C-Designs. We encourage you to rely as little as possible on boilerplate, libraries or frameworks. We want to see you write HTML, CSS and JS from scratch as much as possible here. That said, if this looks difficult to complete in under five hours without skipping writing a grid system, for example, feel free to use a minimal library.
2. As you’ll see in the designs, there are three viewport sizes included, we do want to see all three working in what you produce.
3. Links and buttons don’t have to lead anywhere, but we would like to see the hamburger menu functioning, this is a chance to showcase some JS skills.
4. Additionally, for both tablet and mobile viewport sizes, please use JavaScript to add an appropriate class ‘tablet’ or ‘mobile’ to all buttons.
5. Double and triple check that everything looks good, and feel free to add comments in code or a README.txt to explain your approach if you’d like.
6. Package up just your page in a zip file and email it back to us (no links to public repos please!). Sometimes candidates need to upload the zip to Google Drive first, definitely double check the attachment comes through. We should be able to open your html file in a browser and see everything looking good and responsive.
7. You have 48 hours to return this exercise back to us. Good luck, and feel free to reach out with any questions!
